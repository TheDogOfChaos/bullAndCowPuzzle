Your aim is to crack the code that the computer has generated.

Set the difficulty via the URL parameter `?diff=0` (just type it after the url and replace the 0 with a number from 1 to 8), and get cracking.

A Bull means you have the right digit in the right position, whereas a Cow means you have the right digit, but in the wrong position.

You cannot enter in a digit more than once.
