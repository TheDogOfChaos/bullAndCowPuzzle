Play it here: https://thedogofchaos.github.io/bullAndCowPuzzle/?diff=4 (Difficulty level 4)

Your aim is to crack the code that the computer has generated.

Set the difficulty via the URL parameter `diff` (just replace the 4 with a number from 1 to 8), and get cracking.

A Bull means you have the right digit in the right position, whereas a Cow means you have the right digit, but in the wrong position.
